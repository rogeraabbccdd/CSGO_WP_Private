# Francisco Weapon Paints 4.0.3
Leaked by xCoderx(https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=286016)

This repo is based on xCoderx's leaked sp file, and I'm trying to make it work in game.

LEAKED 6.X NEW VERSION! --> https://github.com/b3none/private-ws  

LEAKED LATEST VERSION!  --> https://github.com/WardPearce/Franc1sco-Franug-Leaked-Plugins

## How To Use
Put files into your server.

Go to "addons/sourcemod/configs/core.cfg", change "FollowCSGOServerGuidelines" to "no".

## How To Add Skins
You can find skin ID in "csgo/scripts/itemsitems_game.txt"

You can find skin name in "csgo/resource/csgo_xxx.txt"

You can find sourcemod languages name in "configs/languages.cfg"

And name your weapon paints cfg to "csgo_wpaints_yoursourcemodlanguagename".

For example, English is "csgo_wpaints_english.cfg", Russian is "csgo_wpaints_Russian.cfg"

Or you can use [adamb70's CSGO skin ID dumper](https://github.com/adamb70/CSGO-skin-ID-dumper) to get skin ID and skin name.
